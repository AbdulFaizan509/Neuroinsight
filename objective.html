            The objective of the project is to develop an advanced artificial intelligence model capable of accurately detecting the presence of brain tumours in individuals and precisely localizing the tumour within the brain.
Leveraging machine learning algorithms and medical imaging data, the goal is to create a sophisticated diagnostic tool, enhancing early detection capabilities and providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals to optimize treatment planning and improve patient outcomes.
